# Developed APIs for the Frontend<br></br>
Created the following Entities and developed APIs to perform CRUD operations on them:<br></br>
    User<br></br>
    Admid<br></br>
    Mission<br></br>
    Mission Theme<br></br>
    Mission Skill<br></br>

Learned the concept of Authentication and Authorization.<br></br>
Got the understanding about Type of Authentication(Here I have used *http*)<br></br>
# We have to write "Bearer" before the token when the Type is *apikey* to Authorize.
# No need to write "Bearer" before the token when the Type is *Http* to Authorize.
